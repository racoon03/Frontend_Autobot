// Define action types as constants
export const LOGIN_SUCCESS = 'LOGIN_SUCCESS';
export const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

// You can define action creators here as well, although they are not strictly necessary for simple actions
// For example:
/*
export const loginSuccess = (payload) => ({
  type: LOGIN_SUCCESS,
  payload,
});

export const logout = () => ({
  type: LOGOUT,
});
